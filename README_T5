This is my port of Dilemma's excellent T5Suite2 application, although most of the hard work was done by s900t8v and Mattias Cleasson. I took s900t8v's version of Dilemma's source code and added some missing third party packages.

I've updated T5CANLib with my latest version that includes reliability improvements, Just4Trionic support and works with more replacement FLASH Chips (Atmel 29C010, numerous 29F010 and SST39SF010).

I've also included my new imagining of the T5 CAN Flasher too :-)


Third Party Packages
====================

In order to compile you must also have some commercial libraries or copy the required DevExpress and Nevron .DLL files to the 'reference files' folder. These Libraries come bundled with Dilemma's T5Suite package and can be found in your 'C:\Program Files\Dilemma\T5SuiteII' folder. Simply copy DevExpress*.* and Nevon*.* to the reference files folder.
